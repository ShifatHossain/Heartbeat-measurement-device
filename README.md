# Blood flow measuring Photoplethysmograph (PPG) design (2015) 
Designed a low-cost Arduino-based photoplethysmograph device during undergraduate studies. It was designed to measure the blood flow in the reflection form. IR light was emitted from the soft-side of the fingertip and this signal was sensed using an IR sensor, separated about 3mm from the IR light generator in the same plane.
